Xcode Hardware Performance
==========================

These are the results from running Xcode on a non-trivial open source project using various Macs. The goal is to give developers a relative idea of how each computer model compares to one another. Read the [specifics](#specifications) and [contributing](#contributing) sections for more info.

Specifications
--------------

For the test, I decided to use an app that I actually work on: [eidolon](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon). 

For "fresh" builds, I cleaned the build folder (âŒ˜â‡§K) repeatedly until it worked with no permissions problems. Then I sat and waited for Xcode to index the project. I also made sure the simulator was _closed_, so these times include booting the simulator and launching the app. Then I hit âŒ˜R and start a timer, only ending it when the app had fully launched.

"Incremental" builds represent a more common use case: changing one file and recompiling with the simulator already running. I added `print("hello!")` to `application(: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` and hit âŒ˜R, timing the time it took for the app to launch. 

I repeated each test a few times and took their average times. 

Contributing
------------

It would be super-cool if we could perform the above tests on a variety of machines and consolidate the results here. You can [follow the instructions](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon#downloading-the-code) to download the code and the project dependencies, and send a pull request adding your own results. I'd super-appreciate it! :bow:
